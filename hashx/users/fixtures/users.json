            "biography": "Dr. Rajeev Mehta is Professor of Chemical Engineering, at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala, India. Dr. Mehta was appointed in 2000 to Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology as an Assistant Professor (Reader) in the Department of Chemical Engineering. Here he brought rich research experience in the area of polymers from an earlier stint of about three years at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, USA as a scientist, and a 1½ years stint at SRI, Delhi, India. Also, the research training received at Virginia Tech, USA during his Master’s thesis work also broadened his horizons. While abroad in US, Dr. Mehta did very useful work with regard to development of graphitic foams and almost defect free thin films for non-linear optical properties determination, for the US Air Force. Back in India, he developed polyether oil, which has major use in nuclear reactors. At TIET, Dr. Mehta forayed into many new research areas including synthesis, processing of thermosets, and modeling and simulation, in Polymers. He is regarded as an authority in the area of polymer nanocomposites after having worked with nanocomposites of Polylactic acid, Polyurethanes, Epoxy fibre reinforced composites, microwave in-situ processing, etc. His work on the microwave synthesis of Polylactic acid and its nanocomposites has been acknowledged world over. He has also worked in the area of chemical sequestration of carbon dioxide into high value polycarbonates. Working in a very different area, he developed the technology to incorporate the low dielectric strength polymers into cellulose insulating paper, used in transformers. In the just concluded two projects, his research has major implications for the Indian Navy and Army. Working on the project - Processing and characterization of fiber reinforced polymer nanocomposites and their degradation in marine environments, he developed the technology to incorporate nano-filers in the traditional FRP giving products with much reduced ingress of sea water. Also, working on the project - Studies on STF – nanoclay based composites for personal armour systems, he developed a technology which has major implications for the Indian Army, in the area of better protection armour against fast projectiles. However, this technology is still far from the desired results and future projects will utilize the findings of this work in developing better products. His contributions in the area of polymers has been recognized by many awards including a recent award given for the “Best Innovative Young Researcher” at the 4th International Conference on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICONN 2017) at SRM University. This award had been constituted for the first time in the conference, which is the fourth one in this series of the conferences at SRM, and is in addition to the traditional poster and oral presentations awards. Another prestigious award was conferred upon by PlastIndia Foundation, an apex plastics organization of India. Dr. Mehta and his co-worker won the gold trophy in the PlastIndia 2018 held at Gandhinagar, Gujarat, for the category: Best Research in Polymer Sciences, Technology and Engineering. Specifically, the award has been given for our work on “Glass fiber reinforced epoxy-silyated clay nanocomposites”, having implications for the Indian navy. Earlier in 2015, his research work, in the category of Research in the Field of Polymer Science & Technology for the Innovation in “Chemical Fixation of Carbon dioxide and Propylene Oxide to Poly (Propylene Carbonate) and Cyclic Carbonate” was selected as Joint Runners up (from 47 entries from all over the country) for 5th National Award for Technology Innovation in Petrochemicals & Downstream Plastics Processing Industry, given by Ministry of Fertilizers and Chemicals. Represented the university to successfully bag the 3rd FICCI Higher Education Excellence award in the category of Enabling Research, in 2016. He has completed seven research projects, and has 67 peer-reviewed international publications and four encyclopedia chapters to his credit. He has guided 12 PhD students and 27 M.Tech students. His current H index is 16 and the number of citations stands at about 1300, according to Google scholar. Very recently, Dr. Mehta has tried to foray into the interesting world of Entrepreneurship. Towards this, Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology facilitated a one-month training program on entrepreneurship at University of Groningen, The Netherlands, during March 2017. Here, Dr. Mehta team won the third prize in the Venture lab weekend at Groningen, The Netherlands, organized by University of Groningen Center for Entrepreneurship."
